This repository is a rebase for my NixOS configs. I've found that [[https://github.com/wimpysworld/nix-config/tree/main][Wimpy's]] NixOS config was good to initially base and learn from. But my desires and preferences differ enough that it gets in the way more than helps. Hence this config.

I'll start with one machine, which should be most of the work because shared resources are shared, and expand out.
